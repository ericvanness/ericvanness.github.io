            <h1>Hey, I'm Eric</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm Eric Van Ness, and I am originally from Peachtree Corners, Georgia.
                    Currently, I am studying Computer Science and Economics at Georgia Tech, and will be graduating this May.
                    This Summer, I plan to travel Europe, compete in triathlons, and retrain myself to wake up at a time that doesn't make brunch feel like breakfast.
                    Come Fall, I'll be moving to Chicago to join IMC Trading as a Quantitative Trader.
                </p>

                    This website currently (hopefully) showcases a bit of my professional experience, though I hope to expand it when I have time to include more of my interests.
                    I enjoy using tech as a tool to automate, build, and flash my creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to take a look around!
